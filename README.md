# InputSanitizer

InputSanitizer is a filter used to clear all illegal strings from the data received by the API or MVC Controller.

It is based on HtmlSanitizer as an HTML-related cleaner, and also adds Regex pattern matching cleanup.

It supports data model binding in DTO mode and also supports dynamic types based on Json.
